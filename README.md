# Basic Files for a Laboratory of Experimental Economics
**Author:** Marco Gutierrez

The main purpose of this repo is to make public some of the basic software tools in order to set up a lab in experimental economics.
Here you will be able to find some files neccesary to:

1. Literature to understand the basics of lab experimental econ

1. Control the computers of an Ubuntu based lab

1. Create experimental economic projects in oTree

## Literature to understand the basics of lab experimental econ
Here you will find literature about

1. Types of Experiments

1. Induced Value Theory

1. Game Theory

## Controling the computers of an Ubuntu based lab
Many of the stuff needs to be done with shell scripts.

## Create experimental economic projects in oTree
oTree is the main programming package used for the experimental economics labs in Per√∫, so that's why Ztree won't be seen anywhere over here. In order to use the tools in the repo and assuming you have installed some Python version as well as `pip`, run the following commands

```
  pip install virtualenv
  pip install otree
```

In the otree_environments, you'll find 2 virtual environments to work in the two main versions of otree

1. Old oTree - otree 2.2.x (Python 3.6)
1. New oTree - otree (Python 3.7)
